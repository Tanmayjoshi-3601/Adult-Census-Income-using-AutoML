The goal of this project is to predict the adult census income of the people around the world. We use the AutoML library by H2O.AI for the same. We analyze different models to analyze the best fit for the data. Various metrics were evaluated to determine the best model. We also infer the best hyperparamters for the model. Only applying AutoML it was found that the Stacked Ensemble approach gave the best results outperforming the naive Machine Learning models.


Dataset
The "Adult Census Income" dataset is primarily about demographic and employment-related information of individuals in the United States. It is used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year, making it a binary classification problem. The dataset provides various features such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, and more, which can be used to analyze and make predictions about an individual's income level based on these attributes.
